##  MASK WEARING & TRACK & TRACE
You will note that many of the COVID restrictions are thankfully being lifted, hopefully we will get back to 'normal' in the not to distant future.  

However, following considerations this week, we have decided that it will be sensible to be cautious and continue with the restrictions for a few more weeks. The next review will be at a leaders meeting on the 24th Feb.   Therefore,  please continue to wear masks in church at all times for now. - Not long now (hopefully).

Smile 

After a very long, boring Sermon, a member of the congregation spoke to the vicar, 
saying, “ your Sermon reminded of the Peace and Love of God”. He was really 
thrilled and asked why, “ because it endured forever”, came the reply.

(Obviously this would not be true at Wells Methodists!)


## Prayer Requests

Don't forget we have a prayer requests book in the vestibule.  Please feel free to enter your requests in the book.  The intention is to bring the book up with our requests along with the offering.
